NativeVotes SourceMod plugin

NativeVotes is a SourceMod 1.4/1.5 Plugin that lets plugins use the L4D/L4D2/TF2/CSGO built-in vote screens.
It supplies an API that plugins can use to create and display these votes.

It replaces the BuiltinVotes SourceMod extension and has a few new features as well as bugfixes.
